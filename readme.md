European VAT Number Validation API
===

This service exists to help developers validate EU VAT numbers via a simple REST-based API. 

[See it in action here](http://isvat.appspot.com).

It is a bit of code I wrote in 2008 and hadn’t maintained since. It appears to Mostly Work. However since the original site is not stable, your mileage may vary.

Although it was a little experiment, apparently it is being used in a variety of online commerce sites, etc., so I’ve made it open source it in hopes that others will maintain it as I’m focusing all of my time and energy into [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie).

Update (July, 2015)
---

[isvat.appspot.com](http://isvat.appspot.com) is in the process of being sold to Apilayer Ltd who want to maintain and expand it. 

In the lead up to that I’ve migrated the code from Django App Engine Helper to use [Django-nonrel](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/django-nonrel).

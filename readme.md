European VAT Number Validation API
===

This service exists to help developers validate EU VAT numbers via a simple REST-based API. 

[See it in action here](http://isvat.appspot.com).

It is a bit of code I wrote about five years ago and haven’t maintained since. It appears to Mostly Work. However since the original API is not stable, your mileage may vary.

Although it was a little experiment, apparently it is being used in a variety of online commerce sites, etc., so I’m open sourcing it in hopes that others will maintain it as I’m focusing all of my time and energy into [Codename Prometheus](http://thelink.is/prometheus).

Hope this helps.
